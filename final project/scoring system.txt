* only count blacks:
	score dependent on the black numbers in the original image, no universal threshold

* count blacks and whites:
	some whites in the corner give too many scores

* divided by the overlapped area:
	the smaller the overlapped area is, the higher score it gets

* same color numbers divided by different color numbers:
	highly dependent on the overlapped area
